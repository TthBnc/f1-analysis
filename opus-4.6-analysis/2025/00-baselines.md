## Season Narrative Entering 2025

### Key Storylines
1. **McLaren defending** — First back-to-back attempt since 1998-99
2. **Hamilton at Ferrari** — Dream move, 7x WDC seeking #8
3. **Verstappen hunting #5** — Can Red Bull give him the car?
4. **Antonelli's debut** — Replacing a 7x WDC at Mercedes
5. **Sainz at Williams** — Can he lift the team to regular points?
6. **Lawson's chance** — Finally gets a full season, later promoted to Red Bull
7. **Tsunoda promoted** — Mid-season move to Red Bull alongside Verstappen

### Pre-Season Power Ranking
1. McLaren (defending champions, continuity)
2. Red Bull (Verstappen factor, but lost Newey)
3. Ferrari (Hamilton + Leclerc on paper is fearsome)
4. Mercedes (Russell strong, but Antonelli is unproven)
5. Williams (Sainz is a game-changer)
6. Aston Martin (stagnation concerns)
7. Haas (new driver energy)
8. Racing Bulls (junior team shuffle)
9. Sauber (Audi transition limbo)
10. Alpine (Renault PU in its final year)
