# 2025 Round 7 — Emilia Romagna Grand Prix — Qualifying
**Circuit:** Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari, Imola | **Date:** Saturday, 17 May 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Oscar Piastri secured his third pole position of the 2025 season with a stunning 1:14.670 on his final Q3 run, edging Max Verstappen by just 0.034 seconds. The session was one of the most dramatic qualifying hours of the year, marred by two significant Q1 crashes that caused lengthy red flag delays and ultimately reshaped the entire grid.

Yuki Tsunoda's horrifying rollover at the Villeneuve chicane (Turn 6) brought out the first red flag, with his RB21 flipping over the barrier before landing back on its wheels. The Japanese driver walked away unharmed but failed to set a time, condemning him to a pit lane start. Minutes after the restart, Alpine debutant Franco Colapinto spun into the barriers at Tamburello after clipping the grass, triggering a second red flag and significant barrier repair delays.

The biggest shock of the session was Ferrari's disastrous double Q2 elimination at their home race. Charles Leclerc (P11) missed the Q3 cut by just 0.082 seconds, while Lewis Hamilton (P12) was a further tenth behind. Both SF-25s were haemorrhaging time in the slower corners — up to 12 km/h slower at apex speed through the Villeneuve chicane compared to the front-runners. It was Ferrari's worst qualifying at Imola in the track's F1 history. Meanwhile, the midfield produced surprises: Fernando Alonso topped Q1 before securing P5 in Q3, Williams got both cars into Q3, and rookie Isack Hadjar delivered a remarkable P9 for Racing Bulls.

## Top 3 Car Technical Analysis

### P1 — McLaren MCL39 (Piastri)
McLaren's MCL39 continued to demonstrate its qualifying superiority at high-downforce circuits. The car's exceptional aero efficiency — the best drag-to-downforce ratio on the grid — gave Piastri the confidence to carry speed through Imola's flowing medium-speed sections (Acque Minerali, Piratella). The McLaren's balanced mechanical platform allowed Piastri to attack the curbs aggressively, particularly through the Variante Alta chicane. Sector 2 was where McLaren's advantage was most visible, with superior traction out of the slow Villeneuve chicane and stability through the high-speed Tosa approach. Both McLarens made Q3 comfortably, confirming the car's broad setup window.

### P2 — Red Bull RB21 (Verstappen)
Verstappen's 1:14.704 was a masterclass in driver extraction. The RB21 was marginally slower through the high-speed sweeps but Verstappen compensated with his trademark late-braking precision, particularly into Tamburello and Tosa. The Honda RBPT power unit delivered strong sector 1 performance on the run from Rivazza to the start/finish line. Notably, Verstappen was quickest in Q1 (1:15.175) before Piastri found extra pace in Q3. The RB21's narrow setup window appeared less of a factor at Imola, where the high-downforce configuration suited the car's fundamental aerodynamic concept. The 0.034s gap to pole suggested Red Bull had closed the qualifying deficit to McLaren compared to earlier rounds.

### P3 — Mercedes W16 (Russell)
Russell extracted a strong P3, 0.137s off pole, in what was Mercedes' best qualifying of the weekend relative to expectations. The W16 showed improved high-speed stability through Piratella and the Rivazza complex compared to earlier high-downforce venues. However, the car's persistent low-speed traction weakness was evident through the Villeneuve and Variante Alta chicanes. Teammate Antonelli's P13 elimination in Q2 underlined how dependent the W16 is on elite driver input to overcome its inherent balance limitations. Russell's lap was a case of the driver flattering the car.

## Driver Performance Ratings

| Driver | Rating | Justification |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Oscar Piastri | 9.5/10 | Third pole of the season. Sublime final Q3 lap under immense pressure, finding 0.544s from Q1 to Q3. Clinical execution across all three sessions despite the chaotic red-flag disruptions. |
| Max Verstappen | 9.0/10 | Just 0.034s from pole. Outstanding first sector in Q1. Adapted brilliantly to the disrupted session rhythm. Could not quite match Piastri's final Q3 run but positioned himself perfectly for a front-row start at a track where qualifying position is critical. |
| George Russell | 8.5/10 | Excellent P3 result, 0.137s off pole. Extracted every last tenth from the W16, particularly impressive given Antonelli's P13. This was a lap that significantly outperformed the car's baseline pace. |
| Fernando Alonso | 8.5/10 | Topped Q1 outright with a 1:15.158 — faster than Verstappen's Q1 effort. Secured P5 in Q3, Aston Martin's best qualifying of the season. The 43-year-old continues to defy age at circuits rewarding precision and experience. |
| Carlos Sainz | 8.0/10 | Topped Q2 with a remarkable 1:15.198. P6 in Q3 is an excellent result for Williams. Consistent across all three sessions and ahead of his more highly-rated teammate in qualifying trim. |
| Alex Albon | 7.5/10 | Solid P7 and into Q3 for the fourth time this season. Just 0.041s behind Sainz in Q3. The Williams pair's double Q3 appearance underlines the FW46's genuine step forward. |
| Lando Norris | 7.0/10 | P4 is underwhelming in a car that took pole. Over 0.29s behind Piastri in Q3 is a significant gap between teammates. Struggled to hook up the final sector throughout the session. Not disastrous but clearly second-best at McLaren this weekend. |
| Lance Stroll | 7.5/10 | P8 and into Q3 is a strong result. Kept pace with Alonso better than usual — just 0.150s behind in Q3. One of his better qualifying performances of the season. |
| Isack Hadjar | 8.0/10 | P9 as a rookie at a demanding old-school circuit is outstanding. Just 0.043s behind the much more experienced Stroll. A statement performance that justified Racing Bulls' faith in the French-Algerian driver. |
| Pierre Gasly | 7.0/10 | P10 and the last man into Q3. Squeezed every ounce from the Alpine's weak Renault power unit. Adequate rather than spectacular but mission accomplished for the team. |
| Charles Leclerc | 4.0/10 | P11 at Ferrari's home race is devastating. Missed Q3 by 0.082s but the underlying pace deficit was larger — shipping 12 km/h at slow-corner apexes. Leclerc himself admitted the car is "P-nowhere." While the car shares blame, Leclerc has previously dragged worse Ferraris into Q3 at Imola. |
| Lewis Hamilton | 4.0/10 | P12, slightly worse than Leclerc, continues his qualifying struggles at Ferrari. Still adapting to the SF-25's unique characteristics. The gap to his teammate was small, but both Ferraris being eliminated together amplifies the disappointment. |
| Kimi Antonelli | 5.5/10 | P13 is below par given Russell's P3. The gap between Mercedes teammates (+0.946s in Q2) is too large to explain purely through car factors. Still clearly learning the W16's idiosyncrasies at a technical circuit. |
| Gabriel Bortoleto | 6.0/10 | P14, outqualifying his more experienced teammate Hulkenberg. Steady progression through Q1 and improved in Q2. A quietly solid performance in the weakest car on the grid. |
| Franco Colapinto | 3.0/10 | Crashed out of Q1 at Tamburello after dipping a wheel on the grass. For a debut weekend, it was a costly error that denied him any meaningful running and damaged the team's weekend. Also received a grid penalty for pit lane protocol violation. |
| Liam Lawson | 5.0/10 | P16, eliminated in Q1 while teammate Hadjar made Q3. The 0.10s gap to Q2 elimination was small, but being outqualified by a rookie teammate by over 0.7s across sessions is a concerning deficit. |
| Nico Hulkenberg | 5.0/10 | P17 and outqualified by rookie teammate Bortoleto. Struggled with the Sauber's lack of rear-end grip through Imola's technical sections. Expected more from the experienced German. |
| Esteban Ocon | 4.5/10 | P18 in Q1. The Haas VF-25 struggled at Imola but Ocon should be extracting more. Bearman's deleted time complicates the teammate comparison, but this was a forgettable session. |
| Oliver Bearman | 4.0/10 | Lap time deleted, classified P19. The specifics around the deletion remain murky, but the result is the result. Needs to avoid controversial situations. |
| Yuki Tsunoda | 2.0/10 | A terrifying crash that could have been far worse. Lost control entering the Villeneuve chicane and rolled violently over the barriers. The bravery to race from pit lane the next day earns some credit, but this was an entirely self-inflicted qualifying disaster at a race where track position is paramount. |

## Key Observations

1. **Session chaos favoured the disciplined.** The two red flags in Q1 destroyed rhythm and tire preparation windows. Drivers who stayed calm and delivered on restart laps (Piastri, Verstappen, Alonso) thrived. Those who were already on the edge (Tsunoda, Colapinto) paid the price.

2. **Ferrari's home humiliation exposes a structural issue.** The SF-25's slow-corner deficit is not a setup problem — it is a fundamental aerodynamic/mechanical weakness. Both drivers independently confirmed the car simply lacks potential in this operating window. With Monaco (another high-downforce, slow-corner circuit) next on the calendar, the outlook is grim.

3. **Williams is the real deal.** Getting both Sainz and Albon into Q3 at a circuit where overtaking is notoriously difficult gives them an excellent foundation for the race. Sainz topping Q2 was not a fluke — the FW46 has genuine mid-to-high downforce performance now.

4. **Aston Martin's surprise resurgence.** Alonso topping Q1 and both cars in Q3 was unexpected. The AMR25 appears to work well at high-downforce circuits, suggesting the team's development path is finally bearing fruit.

5. **The Verstappen vs. Piastri qualifying duel is emerging as the season's defining battle.** 0.034s separated them. At a track where track position is everything, this fight will define the race.

6. **Red Bull's Q1 exit at Imola (Tsunoda) was their first since 2006.** A remarkable statistical anomaly that reflects the volatility Tsunoda brings to the team.
