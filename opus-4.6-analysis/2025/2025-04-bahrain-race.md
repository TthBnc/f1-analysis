# 2025 Round 4 -- Bahrain Grand Prix -- Race
**Circuit:** Bahrain International Circuit, Sakhir | **Date:** Sunday, April 13, 2025 | **Start Time:** 18:00 local (UTC+3) | **Laps:** 57 | **Distance:** 308.238 km

## Executive Summary

Oscar Piastri produced one of the most complete race performances of the 2025 season, converting pole position into a dominant 15.499-second victory to become the first multiple winner of the year and take the championship lead. The Australian was in total control from lights out, building a seven-second lead before the safety car on Lap 31 wiped it clean, then calmly rebuilt his advantage in the final 21 laps. McLaren achieved their first-ever win at the Bahrain Grand Prix, and Piastri collected the grand slam: pole, win, fastest lap (1:35.140).

The race was defined by three distinct phases. The opening stint saw Piastri pull away on soft tires while Norris pitted early on Lap 10 to serve his five-second grid penalty and deploy an undercut strategy. The mid-race safety car, triggered by a Tsunoda-Sainz collision at Turn 1 on Lap 31, re-zeroed the field and forced a critical tire strategy decision that split the top teams: Piastri took mediums, Russell gambled on softs, and Ferrari fatally chose hard tires for both cars. The final phase saw Norris on fresher mediums hunt down and pass Leclerc for the final podium spot with five laps remaining, while Ferrari's hard tire gamble left Leclerc unable to defend.

Red Bull endured a nightmare race. Verstappen was hampered by a traffic light system malfunction during his first pit stop, a stuck front-right wheel during his second stop (6.2 seconds), and chronic tire degradation that saw him running dead last at one point before recovering to sixth. Hulkenberg was disqualified post-race for excessive plank wear, and Lawson accumulated 15 seconds in penalties for two separate collisions. Antonelli's promising race was ruined by an ill-timed Mercedes strategy that required a three-stop, dropping him from podium contention to a pointless P11.

## Race Narrative

### Phase 1: Opening Stint (Laps 1-30)

**Start:** Piastri made a clean getaway from pole. Norris rocketed from P6 to P3 by the end of Lap 1 with an aggressive first-lap surge, but the stewards noted his grid box infringement and issued a 5-second penalty. Leclerc held P2 from the grid (promoted from P3 by Russell's penalty). Hamilton started on mediums (one of five to do so) and conceded positions early but aimed for a longer first stint.

**Lap 10:** Norris pitted early (Soft to Medium), serving his 5-second penalty in the process. He re-joined P15 but immediately began exploiting the undercut with fresh rubber. McLaren's decision to pit Norris early was strategically astute -- it neutralised the penalty and gave him clean air to build pace.

**Lap 15:** Piastri made his first stop (Soft to Medium), re-joining 2 seconds ahead of Russell. The pit window for front-runners was Laps 13-17, with the soft tires showing severe degradation after 13 laps on Bahrain's abrasive surface.

**Laps 15-30:** Piastri extended his lead to 7+ seconds over Russell. The McLaren's tire management was visibly superior, with Piastri maintaining consistent lap times while others saw progressive degradation. Antonelli was having a strong race, overtaking Gasly (Lap 10, Turn 4) and later making a bold pass on Verstappen (Lap 20, exiting Turn 4).

### Phase 2: Safety Car (Laps 31-35)

**Lap 31:** Tsunoda and Sainz battled for P6 at Turn 1. Exiting the corner, Tsunoda appeared to lose the rear and made contact with Sainz's Williams, punching a hole in the sidepod. Debris scattered across the circuit, triggering the safety car. Sainz continued with damage but would eventually retire on Lap 46.

**Pit Stops Under SC:** The entire field dived into the pits. The tire choices split the field:
- **Piastri:** Medium (optimal -- preserved balance with known compound)
- **Russell:** Soft (aggressive -- hoping for pace advantage at restart)
- **Leclerc/Hamilton:** Hard (conservative -- targeting thermal management but ultimately too slow)
- **Norris:** Medium (same as Piastri -- strong end-of-race pace)

**Red Bull disaster:** Verstappen's first pit stop was already slow due to the traffic light system malfunction (the green light failed to illuminate despite the car being ready). His second stop under the safety car saw the front-right wheel stick, resulting in a catastrophic 6.2-second pit stop that dropped him to last place temporarily.

**Antonelli's misfortune:** Mercedes had pitted Antonelli onto softs just laps before the safety car, meaning they had to pit him again under the SC -- his third stop of the race. He dropped from a strong position to outside the points.

### Phase 3: Restart to Flag (Laps 36-57)

**Lap 36:** Piastri managed a clean safety car restart. Behind him, Norris and Hamilton battled intensely for P4, with Hamilton on hard tires initially holding position before Norris's medium tire advantage told.

**Laps 40-50:** Leclerc's hard tire choice began to backfire. The compound took too long to reach its operating window after the safety car, and once there, offered less ultimate grip than Norris's mediums. Leclerc was visibly struggling with rear tire warm-up through the slow-speed corners.

**Lap 52:** Norris made his move on Leclerc at Turn 4 after several laps of pressure, taking P3 and the final podium position. Leclerc had no response on the hard tires.

**Lap 57:** Piastri crossed the line 15.499 seconds clear. Russell held a comfortable P2, while Norris's recovery drive from P6 on the grid (and P15 after his early pit stop) yielded a podium.

### Post-Race Incidents
- Lawson's first penalty (5s) came for contacting Stroll's Aston Martin during the safety car period -- a clumsy error under neutralised conditions.
- Lawson's second penalty (10s) was for causing a collision with Hulkenberg, taking his season penalty points to five.
- Sainz was penalised 10s for forcing Antonelli off at Turn 10 after the restart, though his retirement made it moot.
- Hulkenberg's disqualification for plank wear (below 9mm minimum) removed him from the results entirely.

## Top 3 Car Technical Analysis

### McLaren MCL39 (P1, P3)
The MCL39 was the outstanding car at Sakhir across all performance metrics. Its aero efficiency advantage -- the ability to generate competitive downforce without excessive drag -- translated into both qualifying speed and race-long tire preservation. On the medium compound for the second and third stints, Piastri's degradation rate was approximately 0.08s per lap slower than Russell and 0.15s per lap slower than Leclerc, representing a massive accumulated advantage over 20+ lap stints. The car's rear stability through the high-energy Turn 12-13 complex and the traction zones out of Turns 1, 4, and 10 was notably better than any rival. McLaren's cooling package also handled the extreme thermal demands (ambient 28C, track 35C) without requiring bodywork compromises. The only weakness was Norris's inability to match Piastri's tire warm-up speed on cold mediums after his early Lap 10 pit stop.

### Mercedes W16 (P2, P11)
Russell's P2 was a strong result that confirmed the W16's step forward, but the team's operational execution was poor. The car showed genuine race pace improvement in the medium-speed corners, and Russell's soft tire stint in the final phase was aggressive but effective -- he maintained position on Norris for many laps before the McLaren's superior race pace told. However, the decision to pit Antonelli onto softs just before the safety car was a strategic miscalculation that destroyed a potential points haul. The W16's tire degradation on the soft compound was manageable in cooler evening conditions but higher than the McLaren or Ferrari on the same rubber. The car's braking stability was noticeably improved over the opening three rounds.

### Ferrari SF-25 (P4, P5)
The new floor upgrade showed genuine race pace improvement -- Leclerc was competitive for a podium through most of the race, and Hamilton's second stint (on mediums) was his strongest driving of the weekend, during which he "figured out" the car's preferred driving style. However, Ferrari's safety car strategy was a critical error. Fitting hard tires on both cars was overly conservative; the hard compound took too long to warm up (3-4 laps to reach operating temperature vs. 1 lap for mediums), and by the time it was performing, Leclerc had already lost position to Norris's faster mediums. The SF-25's rear-end warm-up deficiency -- already a known weakness -- was amplified by the hard compound's thermal characteristics. Hamilton's race from P9 to P5 demonstrated recovering ability and validated the floor upgrade's contribution to long-run pace, but the qualifying-to-race inconsistency remains an issue.

## Driver Performance Ratings

| Driver | Rating | Justification |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Oscar Piastri | 10/10 | Grand slam performance. Controlled the race from pole, managed the safety car restart expertly, and rebuilt a 15-second lead in the final 21 laps. Fastest lap on Lap 54 showed he had pace in hand throughout. Flawless tire management, zero errors. |
| George Russell | 8/10 | Solid P2 recovery after grid penalty. Made the right calls on track and his soft tire gamble at the safety car gave him the best of the non-McLaren strategies. Couldn't match Piastri's pace but maximised his car's potential. |
| Lando Norris | 7.5/10 | The podium recovery from P15 (after early pit + penalty) was impressive, and his overtake on Leclerc with five laps to go was clinical. However, the grid penalty for overshooting his marks was a self-inflicted error that cost him a chance to fight Russell for P2. McLaren labelled it a "misjudgement." |
| Charles Leclerc | 7/10 | Strong race pace until the safety car ruined his rhythm. Held P2/P3 for most of the race and was unlucky with the hard tire strategy call, but could have pushed harder to keep Norris behind in the closing laps. The tire choice was the team's call, but Leclerc's inability to generate temperature in the hards was a limitation. |
| Lewis Hamilton | 7.5/10 | His best race of the 2025 season. Gained four positions from P9 to P5. His second stint on mediums was revelatory -- he was "really in line with the car" and matching the leaders' pace. Learned critical setup lessons about how the SF-25 wants to be driven. A breakthrough weekend from P9 qualifying masked by the final result. |
| Max Verstappen | 5/10 | A deeply frustrating race where "everything went wrong." The pit stop disasters (light malfunction, stuck wheel) were not his fault, but his tire degradation was worse than Tsunoda in similar machinery and he lost positions on pure pace before the mechanical issues hit. Called the weekend a "catastrophe." |
| Pierre Gasly | 7.5/10 | Secured Alpine's first points of 2025 with P7, from a P4 grid slot. Lost positions at the start and through the pit phase but drove a smart, consistent race. His tire management kept him competitive against faster cars. A very mature drive. |
| Esteban Ocon | 7/10 | Excellent recovery from P13 (after Q2 crash) to P8. After his car was rebuilt overnight, Ocon drove a calm, error-free race and took advantage of others' misfortune. A strong contrast to his qualifying performance. |
| Yuki Tsunoda | 5.5/10 | The contact with Sainz that triggered the safety car was a racing incident (no penalty applied), but Tsunoda appeared to lose the rear exiting Turn 1. P9 was a fair result given Red Bull's pace, but the incident and his gap to Verstappen (despite Max's pit stop issues) were concerning. |
| Oliver Bearman | 7.5/10 | Outstanding drive from P19 on the grid to P10, scoring a point. Made clean passes and managed his tires well in what was a demanding debut-season race at a hostile circuit. A significant step forward from his qualifying performance. |
| Kimi Antonelli | 6.5/10 | His raw pace was excellent -- overtaking Gasly and Verstappen on merit -- but the safety car timing and Mercedes' strategy error pushed him into a three-stop that dropped him to P11. Not his fault, but the result is the result. |
| Alex Albon | 6/10 | Quiet race to P12. Started P12 and finished P12. Did not lose positions on pace but could not find a way to overtake in the midfield train. The Williams simply lacked the race pace to move forward. |
| Carlos Sainz | 5/10 | Started P8 with potential for points, but the 10-second penalty for forcing Antonelli off at Turn 10 and the retirement from damage after the Tsunoda contact made for a dire afternoon. Aggressive driving was penalised and his car paid the price. |
| Isack Hadjar | 6/10 | P13 was a quiet but clean race. Didn't make errors, ran within the car's capability, but also didn't find opportunities to advance. A learning experience. |
| Jack Doohan | 5.5/10 | Started P11 with a chance at points but four track limits violations earned a 5-second penalty, dropping him to P14. A pattern of boundary-pushing that cost him. |
| Fernando Alonso | 5/10 | P15 in a car that is simply not competitive enough. Alonso extracted what he could, but the AMR25 has no answer for the midfield fight. His experience showed in tire management but there was no pace to deploy. |
| Liam Lawson | 3/10 | A weekend to forget. Two collisions -- one under the safety car with Stroll and one with Hulkenberg -- earned 15 seconds of penalties and five penalty points. His racecraft was reckless and undisciplined, the worst performance of any driver on the grid. |
| Lance Stroll | 4.5/10 | P17 is a poor result. Was hit by Lawson under the safety car, but otherwise ran at the back without showing the pace to advance. The gap to Alonso in race trim was significant. |
| Gabriel Bortoleto | 5/10 | P18 in the Sauber was expected. Showed fighting spirit but lacked the car underneath him. Fastest lap of 1:38.006 on Lap 38 was competitive for the machinery. |
| Nico Hulkenberg | N/A | Disqualified for plank wear. Finished P13 on the road but the technical infringement nullifies any performance rating. The excessive wear may indicate the car was running too low, possibly chasing performance the Sauber does not have. |

## Key Observations

1. **Piastri's grand slam redefines the championship picture.** With pole, win, fastest lap, and 15 seconds of dominant margin, Piastri now leads the championship and has established himself as the most complete performer of 2025 so far. His tire management at a circuit rated "Extreme" for tire severity was the performance of the weekend.

2. **The safety car strategy split was the race's pivotal moment.** Piastri on mediums was the optimal call. Russell on softs was aggressive but workable. Ferrari's decision to put both cars on hards was a strategic error that cost Leclerc a podium and Hamilton a potential P4. The hard compound's poor warm-up characteristics -- taking 3-4 laps to reach temperature after a safety car -- were known, making the choice puzzling. Ferrari team principal admitted the SC "spoilt our plans."

3. **Red Bull's crisis is systemic, not circumstantial.** The pit stop light failure and stuck wheel were mechanical misfortunes, but the underlying tire degradation and brake stability issues are structural weaknesses in the RB21. Verstappen finished 34 seconds behind Piastri and described the weekend as a "catastrophe." The car is worse on tires than 2024, which was already a regression from 2023.

4. **Hamilton's breakthrough at Ferrari.** Despite only finishing P5, Hamilton's second stint was his most competitive racing at Ferrari. He stated he "knows what to search for now" in terms of driving the SF-25, suggesting the floor upgrade has given him a platform to adapt his style. The medium-stint pace was comparable to the front-runners.

5. **Bearman's recovery drive was the hidden performance of the weekend.** From P19 to P10 (scoring a point) with a car his teammate crashed in qualifying, the Haas rookie showed genuine race intelligence and consistent pace. This is the type of recovery that builds an F1 career.

6. **Lawson's discipline problem is escalating.** Two collisions in a single race -- one under the safety car, which should be incident-free -- is a concerning pattern. Five penalty points after four races puts him halfway to a race ban. Racing Bulls and Red Bull need to address this urgently.

7. **Mercedes operational errors undercut their car improvement.** The W16 is clearly a faster car than the opening three rounds suggested, but the team's execution (pit lane release error in qualifying, Antonelli strategy catastrophe in the race) is leaving performance on the table. Russell P2 masks a weekend where the team could have scored significantly more.

8. **Bahrain's extreme tire severity rewarded the best tire managers.** Piastri, Russell, and Gasly -- all drivers rated 7.5+ for tire management -- occupied three of the top seven positions. Meanwhile, drivers with weaker tire skills (Verstappen 8.5 baseline but -0.5 this race, Antonelli 6.5) lost positions or were compromised. Circuit-driver attribute matching proved predictive.
