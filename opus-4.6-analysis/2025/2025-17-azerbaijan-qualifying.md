# 2025 Round 17 — Azerbaijan Grand Prix — Qualifying
**Circuit:** Baku City Circuit | **Date:** Saturday, September 20, 2025

## Executive Summary

Max Verstappen delivered a commanding pole position lap of 1:41.117, nearly half a second clear of Carlos Sainz in second (+0.478s), in one of the most chaotic qualifying sessions in Formula 1 history. A record-breaking six red flags shattered the previous mark of five (shared by the 2022 Emilia Romagna GP and 2024 Sao Paulo GP), stretching a scheduled one-hour session beyond two hours of real time. The carnage was spread across all three sessions: Alexander Albon (T1), Nico Hulkenberg (T4), Pierre Gasly (T4), and Franco Colapinto (T4) all crashed out of Q1; Oliver Bearman hit the wall in Q2; Charles Leclerc smashed into the barriers at Turn 15 in Q3; and championship leader Oscar Piastri brought out the sixth and final red flag by crashing at Turn 3 in Q3.

The drama extended beyond track limits. Haas driver Esteban Ocon was disqualified from qualifying after post-session scrutineering found his rear wing deflected 0.6mm (left) and 0.825mm (right) — exceeding the 0.5mm tolerance under tightened flex regulations. This was the first disqualification under the new rear wing deflection rules.

Liam Lawson was the standout performer of the session, qualifying an excellent P3 (+0.590s) for Racing Bulls — his best-ever F1 qualifying result. Sainz's P2 represented Williams' first front-row start since Russell qualified second at the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton, fastest in Friday practice, endured a nightmare qualifying and was eliminated in Q2 (P12). Both Leclerc and Piastri crashed without setting Q3 times, starting P10 and P9 respectively — a devastating blow for the championship leader.

## Top 3 Car Technical Analysis

### 1. Red Bull RB21 — Straight-Line King Meets Street Circuit Precision

The Baku City Circuit's defining feature — the 2.2 km straight from Turn 20 to Turn 1 — is tailor-made for the RB21's Honda power unit advantage. Verstappen was consistently the fastest driver through the speed trap, and the combination of raw power and Red Bull's low-drag rear wing configuration gave him a substantial buffer entering the braking zone for Turn 1.

- **2.2 km Straight Performance:** The Honda RBPT power unit delivered its full advantage on the longest straight in F1. Verstappen's top speed consistently exceeded 340 km/h, and the RB21's DRS efficiency on the low-downforce configuration was devastating. This alone accounted for a significant chunk of the 0.478s pole margin.
- **Old Town Section (Turns 8-12):** This is where most Baku qualifying sessions are won or lost. The narrow, 90-degree corners demand precise low-speed balance, strong front-end turn-in, and confidence under braking into blind corners surrounded by concrete walls. Verstappen's car looked remarkably composed here, with none of the rear instability that plagued earlier 2025 street circuit outings.
- **Brake Performance:** The late-braking zones at Turn 1 (after the long straight), Turn 3, and Turn 15 are among the most demanding on the calendar. Verstappen repeatedly gained time in braking zones, suggesting Red Bull optimized their brake cooling and pedal feel for the specific demands of Baku's stop-start nature.

The 0.478s margin to Sainz was the largest pole gap since the Spanish Grand Prix, and it came at a circuit where margins are typically razor-thin due to the low-grip surface and tow effects on the straights.

### 2. Williams FW46 — Baku's Perfect Playground

Sainz's P2 was not a fluke — it was the logical outcome of the FW46's fundamental design philosophy meeting the one circuit on the calendar that rewards it most. Williams has always run a low-drag package, and Baku's combination of long straights (the 2.2 km main straight plus the shorter straight from Turn 2 to Turn 3) and predominately low-speed corners (where downforce matters less than driver skill) plays directly into their hands.

- **Straight-Line Speed:** The FW46 with Mercedes PU was one of the fastest cars through the speed trap, losing only marginal amounts to the Red Bull. Williams' low-drag philosophy, which hurts them at downforce-demanding circuits like Barcelona, becomes an outright advantage at Baku.
- **Low-Speed Sections:** Sainz's experience and precise driving style compensated for the FW46's lack of mechanical grip in the old town section. The car was never as planted as the Red Bull through Turns 8-12, but Sainz managed the understeer with textbook lines and precise throttle application.
- **Brake Performance:** The FW46 has historically suffered with brake consistency over a qualifying session, but Baku's surface temperatures in September appeared to keep the brakes in their optimal window. Sainz reported strong brake feel throughout the session.

This was Williams' first front-row start since Russell qualified second at the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix — a landmark result that validated the Sainz signing.

### 3. Racing Bulls VCARB 02 — Lawson's Street Circuit Masterclass

Lawson's P3 was one of the great qualifying surprises of the 2025 season. The Racing Bulls has shown flashes of qualifying pace on power-sensitive circuits, but P3 at Baku represented a significant step beyond expectations.

- **Straight-Line Speed:** Sharing the Honda RBPT power unit with Red Bull, the Racing Bulls benefits from the same engine advantage on Baku's straights. While the chassis generates less peak downforce than the RB21, the power unit partially offsets this by providing strong speed through the acceleration zones.
- **Old Town Agility:** The VCARB 02 is a smaller, lighter-feeling car compared to the front-running machinery, and this pays dividends through the tight old town section. Lawson looked supremely confident through the narrow passages, carrying impressive minimum speeds through the 90-degree corners.
- **Braking Stability:** Lawson's braking into Turn 1 after the long straight was notably aggressive — he was frequently late-braking into the zone and maintaining stability. The Honda-powered braking system, with engine braking assistance, gave him confidence that few midfield drivers could match.

Lawson's gap to Verstappen (+0.590s) was tighter than both Mercedes drivers and closer than Norris in the McLaren, suggesting a genuine step forward for the Racing Bulls on power-sensitive circuits.

## Driver Performance Ratings

| Driver | Rating | Justification |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Max Verstappen | 10/10 | Perfect qualifying execution. Pole by 0.478s in a session interrupted by six red flags. Maintained concentration across a two-hour-plus session. The lap was clean, committed, and extracting maximum from the RB21's straight-line advantage. Masterful around the walls of Baku. |
| Carlos Sainz | 9.5/10 | Williams' first front-row start since 2021. Extracted every last tenth from the FW46 at its best circuit. Only 0.478s from Verstappen's Red Bull — a remarkable gap given the car deficit. Composed through every red flag interruption. Statement qualifying for Williams. |
| Liam Lawson | 9.5/10 | Career-best qualifying result by a significant margin. P3 for Racing Bulls at a venue where the Honda PU advantage helps, but the chassis usually limits them. Showed exceptional street circuit instincts through the old town section and superb braking confidence. |
| Kimi Antonelli | 8.5/10 | P4 was his highest qualifying position since Canada. Outqualified teammate Russell by 0.353s — a significant margin — showing real confidence on the street circuit. Clean progression through all three sessions without incident, which was no small feat given the carnage around him. |
| Yuki Tsunoda | 7.5/10 | P6 was solid but 1.006s from Verstappen in similar machinery. The gap was smaller than at Barcelona but still substantial. Clean qualifying without drama, which at Baku is worth something. |
| George Russell | 7/10 | P5 was a disappointing result considering he fought for pole in recent rounds. The illness that plagued him all weekend clearly affected his sharpness. He was the slower Mercedes for the first time since Miami. Given the circumstances (considered pulling out of the weekend), P5 still has merit. |
| Lando Norris | 6.5/10 | P7 was below expectations for the constructors' championship leaders. Made mistakes during his Q3 lap and was unable to string together a clean lap under pressure. Baku exposes the MCL39's low-downforce weakness, but P7 was still underperformance. |
| Isack Hadjar | 7.5/10 | P8 and another Q3 appearance was a tidy result for the rookie. Outqualified by teammate Lawson by 0.494s, but survived the chaos cleanly and built through the sessions. |
| Oscar Piastri | 3/10 | Championship leader crashed at Turn 3 in Q3 without setting a time — only the second crash-related qualifying setback of his F1 career. The Q2 time placed him P9, but the error was unforced. As the title leader, he needed a clean session above all else, and Baku punished his aggression. |
| Charles Leclerc | 3.5/10 | Four consecutive Baku poles, and then a crash at Turn 15 in Q3 without setting a time. Started P10. The crash ended a remarkable record and came at a circuit where Leclerc is historically dominant. The Q2 pace suggested a potential front-row position was available had he completed a clean Q3 lap. |
| Fernando Alonso | 7/10 | P11 was a solid result for Aston Martin. Extracted more from the AMR25 than Stroll by a comfortable margin. At 44 years old, his street circuit instincts remain sharp. |
| Lewis Hamilton | 4/10 | Fastest in Friday practice, then eliminated in Q2. The jump from FP pace to qualifying performance simply did not translate. Unable to string together a clean lap when it mattered. P12 was a major underperformance for a seven-time champion at a circuit where pace was available in the Ferrari. |
| Gabriel Bortoleto | 6.5/10 | P13 and cleanly into Q2. Another qualifying where the rookie outqualified teammate Hulkenberg. Consistent improvement throughout the session. |
| Lance Stroll | 5.5/10 | P14 and eliminated in Q2. Complained of tailwind issues and was 0.177s behind Alonso in Q2. Below par for the circuit where he has historically been competitive. |
| Oliver Bearman | 5/10 | Clipped the wall in Q2, breaking his right-rear suspension. The crash eliminated him without a representative Q2 time. The Haas was competitive enough for Q2 on merit, making the crash more costly. |
| Franco Colapinto | 4.5/10 | P16 and eliminated in Q1. The Alpine lacked pace but Colapinto was also 0.189s behind Gasly's Q1 time (before Gasly himself crashed). Continues to trail Gasly by significant margins. |
| Nico Hulkenberg | 4/10 | Crashed at Turn 4 in Q1, breaking his front wing and ending his session immediately. The Sauber has shown improved form, making a Q1 crash all the more disappointing. Outqualified by rookie teammate Bortoleto again. |
| Pierre Gasly | 4.5/10 | Went off at Turn 4 in the final moments of Q1. Was already in the danger zone pace-wise, but the crash sealed a P18 start. Alpine's lack of straight-line speed (Renault PU) hurts badly at Baku. |
| Alexander Albon | 3/10 | Crashed at Turn 1 early in Q1, destroying his front suspension and steering rack. Had no representative time. Albon had been in the top 10 in all three practice sessions, making the Q1 crash a catastrophic waste of strong weekend pace. |
| Esteban Ocon | DSQ | Set a competitive Q1 time that would have placed him P16, but was disqualified after post-session rear wing deflection tests failed (0.6mm / 0.825mm vs 0.5mm limit). Started from the pit lane. Ocon personally bears no blame for a technical infringement, but the result was a weekend-defining setback for Haas. |

## Key Observations

### Six Red Flags — A Record-Setting Qualification

The six red flags broke the previous record of five (shared between the 2022 Emilia Romagna GP and the 2024 Sao Paulo GP). The stoppages were:

1. **Q1 — Albon at Turn 1** (broken front suspension / steering rack)
2. **Q1 — Hulkenberg at Turn 4** (broken front wing, barrier impact)
3. **Q1 — Gasly at Turn 4** (off-track excursion into barriers)
4. **Q1 — Colapinto at Turn 4** (wall contact shortly after Gasly)
5. **Q3 — Leclerc at Turn 15** (heavy impact, unable to continue)
6. **Q3 — Piastri at Turn 3** (wall impact, session ended shortly after)

The session ran for over two hours instead of the scheduled one hour. Turn 4 was the most common crash site (three incidents), highlighting the particular challenges of braking into this decreasing-radius left-hander on Baku's low-grip surface.

### Ocon Disqualification — First Casualty of Tightened Wing Flex Rules

Haas became the first team to fall foul of the tightened rear wing deflection regulations. FIA technical delegate Jo Bauer found Ocon's rear wing deflected 0.6mm on the left side and 0.825mm on the right side — exceeding the 0.5mm permitted tolerance. The disqualification forced Ocon to start from the pit lane. This sent a clear signal to the entire paddock that the FIA is enforcing the new flex limits strictly, which may have implications for other teams running close to the tolerance at future high-speed circuits.

### Championship Implications — Piastri's Nightmare Start to the Weekend

Oscar Piastri entered Azerbaijan as the championship leader but will start P9 after crashing in Q3. More critically, the crash at Turn 3 suggested an overcommitment — pushing beyond the limits in a session where a clean P4-P6 would have been perfectly acceptable for a title contender. The error had significant strategic consequences: starting P9 on a street circuit where overtaking is difficult (outside of the DRS zone) meant Piastri would need either a stellar start, strategic brilliance, or race-day attrition to recover. As events would prove the following day, the weekend only got worse.

### Williams at Baku — The Perfect Match

The FW46's low-drag design philosophy, which makes it one of the weakest cars at high-downforce circuits, transforms into a competitive advantage at Baku. Sainz's P2 was not an anomaly — it was the logical outcome of Williams' design direction meeting a circuit that demands straight-line speed above all else. This result, combined with Sainz's outstanding car placement through the old town section, demonstrated why the Baku City Circuit has historically produced unexpected qualifying results.

### Intra-Team Qualifying Gaps

| Team | Gap | Leader | Notes |
|------|-----|--------|-------|
| Red Bull | 1.006s | Verstappen | Still a sizeable gap but narrower than Barcelona |
| Williams | N/A | Sainz | Albon crashed; no comparison possible |
| Racing Bulls | 0.494s | Lawson | Lawson's day; Hadjar solid but clearly second-best |
| Mercedes | 0.353s | Antonelli | Antonelli outqualified Russell — illness was a factor for Russell |
| McLaren | N/A | Norris | Piastri crashed; Norris P7 on merit |
| Ferrari | N/A | Hamilton (Q2) | Both underperformed; Leclerc crashed in Q3, Hamilton out in Q2 |
| Sauber | N/A | Bortoleto | Hulkenberg crashed in Q1; Bortoleto cleanly into Q2 |
| Alpine | 0.189s | Colapinto | Both in Q1; Gasly crashed, Colapinto faster on Q1 time |
| Aston Martin | 0.177s | Alonso | Both in Q2; Alonso comfortably ahead |
| Haas | N/A | Ocon (DSQ) | Bearman crashed in Q2; Ocon disqualified |
