# 2025 Driver Roster & Attributes

> Last updated: R01 Australian Grand Prix (post-weekend integration)

## Attribute Scale

All attributes scored **1.0 - 5.0** (one decimal). 3.0 = average for the current grid.
Attributes without enough data are marked `N/A` with a reason.

## Calibration Reference

To ensure scores are meaningful for the prediction algorithm:

- **5.0** = historically elite in this attribute (reserved for clear best-on-grid)
- **4.5** = top 3 on the grid in this attribute
- **4.0** = clearly above average, top ~6
- **3.5** = slightly above average
- **3.0** = grid average
- **2.5** = slightly below average
- **2.0** = notably weak in this attribute
- **1.5** = bottom 3 on the grid
- **1.0** = historically poor (reserved for extreme cases)

The distribution is calibrated near a 3.0 grid midpoint.
